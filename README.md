# Scoutbook Advancement Helper Chrome Extension

When a scout is ready to rank up, they send me a pic of their completed requirements in their physical scoutbook and I enter their rank requirements into the online Scoutbook system. But entering each requirement one-by-one is a terribly tedious process, namely because scoutbook takes a long time to load every time you change pages. This Chrome extension allows me to enter the completion dates and who signed off on all requirements for a rank at one time and then submit all of the requirements at once.

## Installation
